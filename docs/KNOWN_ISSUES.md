# Known Issues

Reproducible defects and deferred risks (`docs/MASTER_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md`
§1.1). This file is also where out-of-scope ideas are parked instead of
broadening a work package (spec §1.5).

## Update rules

- IDs: `KI-####`, never reused.
- Severity: `CRITICAL | HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW`.
- State: `OPEN | IN_PROGRESS | FIXED | DEFERRED | WONT_FIX` (`WONT_FIX`
  requires an owner decision recorded in `docs/DECISIONS.md`).
- Every defect entry must include reproduction steps and the affected work
  package and/or requirement ID.
- A defect is closed only with verification evidence recorded in
  `docs/TEST_EVIDENCE.md`; one passing manual example is not sufficient.
- No `CRITICAL` or `HIGH` issue may remain `OPEN` in a milestone marked
  complete (spec §10.1).
- Mandatory tests may not be labeled flaky to avoid fixing them (spec §8.6).

## Deferred risks and parked ideas

### KI-0001 — No JS/TS `build` task exists in the M00-W02 scaffold (deliberate deferral)

- Severity: LOW
- State: DEFERRED
- Discovered: 2026-07-26 during M00-W02
- Affects: M00-W02 (scaffold); resolved by M03-W01 / M17-W01 (first real build targets) and M00-W04 (aggregate verification semantics)
- Description: the owner's M00-W02 instructions list build configuration among the
  required configs. The TypeScript workspace intentionally defines no `build`
  task: every TypeScript package in the scaffold is a `noEmit` slot with no
  build output, so a Turborepo `build` task would report success over zero
  implementers — a mocked success state (spec §1.5) contrary to the
  "empty suites must fail" principle assigned to M00-W04. Build coverage
  exists today only where real compilation exists (the native-host crate via
  `cargo build`/`cargo test`). The Turborepo pipeline and per-package script
  slots are in place; the `build` task is added together with the first real
  build target (desktop shell M03-W01, extension M17-W01), and M00-W04's
  aggregate `pnpm verify` must fail on skipped mandatory suites.
- Reproduction: `turbo run build` — no such task is defined (by design, this
  errors rather than passing vacuously).
- Workaround: n/a (nothing exists to build yet).
- Resolution + evidence link: pending the packages above.
